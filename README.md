32q - 32x32 Pixel Art Hub
=========================

This is 32q. Since the dawn of ICO files, humankind has been drawn to
the irresistable symbolicism provided by desktop computing icons. From
the early masters in the 70ies and 80ies, back then still in
black & white, this peculiar art form has been driven through the
decades, evolving with every technological advancement of the host
medium. Nowadays icons have become so commonplace, we hardly notice
their simplicistic way of conveying information & culture. They are
everywhere, but we lost the ability to see the pixels beneath their
surface. 32q is a shrine, built to make pixels visible once again.
